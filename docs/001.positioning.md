# Positioning Document

Federa is the platform you own - not the one that owns you.

- Your own email platform with apps
- Your own calendar platform with apps
- Your own blogging platform with apps
- Your own box drop platform with apps
- Your own “Heroku” with addon store

Each of these highlight the nature of making something for creators and all so leaving it suitably unfinished and customizable.

There are actually 2 positioning documents within this file.

There is the positining for publishers/creators and then seperate positioning for developers.
